# Cybersecurity Overview

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, applications, and data from digital attacks.  
These attacks can aim to access, steal, disrupt, or destroy information and services. As technology evolves, so do the threat making cybersecurity a crucial field for individuals and organizations.

## Offensive and Defensive Security

Cybersecurity is generally divided into two main branches:

### **1. Offensive Security**
Offensive security focuses on simulating real-world attacks to identify weaknesses before malicious actors can exploit them.  
It aims to **break, bypass, or exploit** systems in order to improve their security.

Common offensive security activities include:
- Penetration testing  
- Red teaming  
- Vulnerability assessment  
- Exploit development  
- Social engineering simulations  

### **2. Defensive Security**
Defensive security focuses on protecting systems and responding to threats in real time.  
It aims to **detect, prevent, and respond** to cyber attacks.

Common defensive security activities include:
- Monitoring networks and logs  
- Incident detection and response  
- Threat intelligence  
- Malware analysis  
- System hardening  

> **Note:** This article focuses on the *Red Team path only*, but the Blue Team section is explained for clarity.

## Red Team vs Blue Team

### **🟢 Red Team**
The Red Team represents the **attackers**.  
Their job is to think and act like real adversaries.  
They attempt to exploit vulnerabilities, gain unauthorized access, and demonstrate real attack impact.

Red Team focuses on:
- Advanced penetration testing  
- Breach and attack simulations  
- Social engineering  
- Exploit development  
- Post-exploitation and lateral movement  

### **🔵 Blue Team**
The Blue Team represents the **defenders**.  
They work to detect and stop attacks, strengthen systems, and ensure continuous protection.

Blue Team focuses on:
- Monitoring and alerting (SIEM, SOC)  
- Digital forensics  
- Incident response  
- System hardening  
- Threat hunting
